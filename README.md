# Advanced-Lane-Finding
Finding lane lines on the road.

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

# I did the project as follows:

## 1. Camera Calibration

## 2. Distortion Correction

## 3. Thresholding

## 4. Perspective Transform

## 5. Polynomial Fitting

## 6. Calculating Radius of Curvature
